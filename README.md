# Meri's SpaceTraders Client
- Don't expect anything pretty, its my first time working with libcurl and cJSON
- Still WIP  

TODOs:
--
- finish writing API types
- refactor said types
- - mostly moving around enums and optimizing includes
- start writing other API routes
- make a test account
- - I can't test everything I need to using just the stoplight API, I need a throwaway account that I can use to make sure everything is working properly
- add a date type
- - for timestamps and things
- - mainly in case I need to do operations with dates
